Hi there, We're L4BC</a> 👋

## 📝 The purpose of this project is :

- Creating P2P Protocol on top of the UDP 
- Simulating packet loss of data
- HTTP-like operations such as GET and POST

## 💻↔💻 What is P2P Protocol ?
***A peer-to-peer (P2P) network*** is a communications model in which each computing device on the network can function as either a server or a client. In a P2P network, two individuals interact directly with each other, without intermediation by a third party. P2P networks use both TCP and UDP as transport protocols, but there are some differences in each transport protocol.

## Testing
In order to test the protocol, two end-systems are needed. This can be done in the form of multiple VMs or two operating systems for both receiving and sending files.

Initialize Git:
```console
git init
```
Clone the repository:
```console
git clone https://github.com/JugBones/CompNetwork-Assignment-L4BC.git
```
Now run the python scripts for the testing of the POST and GET functions
