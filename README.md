## ðŸ’» The purpose of this project is :

- Creating P2P Protocol on top of the UDP 
- Simulating packet loss of data
- HTTP-like operations such as GET and POST

Initialize Git:
```console
git init
```
Clone the repository:
```console
git clone https://github.com/JugBones/CompNetwork-Assignment-L4BC.git
```
Now run the python scripts for the testing of the POST and GET functions
